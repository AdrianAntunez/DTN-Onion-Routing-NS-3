1 - DTN, ONION ROUTING, DTN ORACLE, MAIN PROBLEM TO BE RESOLVED, BRIEF SOLUTION
2 - DTN ORACLE -> DYNAMIC GRAPH
    DYNAMIC GRAPH -> (ALG*) N PATHS -> ONION ROUTING
    * Non efficient algorithm, needs to be improved but is an example of deterministic choosing.
    SECURITY ANALYSIS
3 - SIMULATION SETUP  ->	NUMBER OF NODES, TRANSMISSION RANGE, WI-FI TYPE, SIMULATION TIME, ETC
    MOBILITY OF NODES ->	REAL SCENARIO FROM OPENSTREETMAPS + SUMO + "HAND" + NS-3 + SUMO
				Sumo grants realistic movement, etc
    SIMULATION RESULTS
