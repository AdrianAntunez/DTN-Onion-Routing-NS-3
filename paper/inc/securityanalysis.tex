\section{Security analysis}\label{sec:sanalysis}

%\red{Aim of this section: â€¢.}

\red{Aim of this section: Brief introduction of what are we going to talk about in this section.}

\subsection{Threat model}

\red{Aim of this section: Define against who we try to defend our data. What the attacker may or may not do. Define some considerations such as sufficient strong cryptographic algorithms with sufficiently long keys to prevent practical cryptanalysis attacks.}

\subsection{Passive adversaries}

\red{Aim of this section: Needs to be defined. I am not even sure if this kind of adversaries will be in our proposed model.}

\subsection{Active adversaries}

\red{Aim of this section: Needs to be defined. I am not even sure if this kind of adversaries will be in our proposed model.}
